# File-System-Development
This is the final project for the course CSE332s at Wasghinton University in St.Louis

Built a software simulation of a file system in C++ with interface similar to the terminal. Specifically, the following features are implemented:

- Create and implement a command called “ls” to list all of the files stored in the file system
- Create and implement a command called “remove” to remove a file from the filesystem
-  Modify the “touch” command to support creating password protected files
-  reate and implement a command called “cat” that concatenates or writes user input into a file
-  reate and implement a command called “ds” that displays the contents of a file based on the file’s type
-  reate and implement a command called “copy” that makes a copy of an existing file
    and stores it in the file system with a different name (prototype pattern)
- reate and implement a command called “rename” that renames an existing file in the
  file system (composite pattern, strategy pattern
